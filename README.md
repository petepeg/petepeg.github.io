## Boids
    This was a quick single day project where I wanted to try and write Boids just based on my interpretation of the rules. I challenged myself not to look at any other implementations of Boids during the process. This turned out to be more difficult than I thought, and has taken much lounger and undergone many revisions to make them flock to my satisfaction.
### Rules
1. **Separation:** steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
2. **Alignment:** steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
3. **Cohesion:** steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
