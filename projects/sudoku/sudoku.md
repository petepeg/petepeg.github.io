# [Sudoku](https://github.com/petepeg/PySudoku)

This Sudoku solver uses backtracking to try and complete the puzzle. Puzzles are generated by filling in random number 1-9 on the diagonal then solving. If the puzzle is solvable than numbers can be removed randomly to create puzzles of varying difficulties. The application is reasonably fast solving or generating a puzzle in usually a fraction of a second.

```python
# Returns True if solved False if no solution found
def solve_puzzle(grid):
    # Active location
    # A List is used here specifically to take advantage of mutable properties of lists in python and their leaky scope
    loc = [0,0]
    
    # Look for an empty cell and set loc
    if find_empty_cell(grid,loc) == False:
        # No empty Cells, were done
        return True
    
    # Set loc based on result of find_empty_cell
    row = loc[0]
    col = loc[1]
    
    # Try and find a safe number
    for num in range(1,10):
        if is_safe(grid, num, row, col) == True:
            # set grid at location to current guess
            grid[row][col] = num
            # Recursively step through the grid
            if solve_puzzle(grid):
                return True
            # bad guess reset to 0
            grid[row][col] = 0
    
    # Backtrack
    return False
